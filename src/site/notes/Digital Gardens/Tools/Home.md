# FAQ
## There is something wrong with this list, is there a way I can help you fix it?
Absolutely! Visit the [Contact](https://forms.fillout.com/t/qMsPWCewKVus) page and fill out the form and I will fix whatever you point out. 

Alternatively, visit our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DudeThatsErin/App-Seeker) and create an issue with any issues you would like to address. You can also fork the repo and add your own apps or changes and I will merge them into my own repo.

Thanks for your help!
## Where are the files located?
When you view the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DudeThatsErin/App-Seeker) you will see the following folders:
![github_repo.png|500](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/github_repo.png)
The files are located in the `src` directory. As of writing this there aren't many notes there *but* they are specifically located in `src/site/notes/Tools`:
![github_repo_notes.png|500](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/github_repo_notes.png)
If you are looking to contribute or you want to clone this repo so you can access this information in your own Obsidian vault (or just to keep for yourself) that's where you would go to look at the notes.

Please make sure to add your information in the `Editor` and `EditorURL` fields in the YAML before pushing your fork. This automatically provides credit on the site to you for having updated any pages.

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know by opening an issue on the GitHub repo or sending me an email.
