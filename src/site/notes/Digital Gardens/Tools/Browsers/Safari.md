# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- You don't have to worry about updating more than once a year when the new operating systems get released.
- It "just works" along with all of Apple's software and hardware. You can use Apple Pay, Apple Passwords, and anything else.
- It is very secure. I have been in the tech field for over 10 years and I haven't see any posts on Reddit or anywhere else about viruses coming on MacOS computers. That has to do with the browser and the operating systems.
## Cons
- Only works on Apple Devices.
- Can't customize the theme.
- Lags behind with feature updates as major updates only come once a year.
# Our Review
I do not own a Mac computer so I cannot adequately review Safari when I've only used it on my iPad or iPhone. The pros and cons you see above are from my time using it on my iPad & iPhone as well as information I gathered from the articles and videos below.
