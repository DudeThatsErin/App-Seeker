# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Advertising and Privacy Blocking is built into the browser. Mozilla doesn't collect as much data on its users as Google and dissociates activity from user identities. Basically this means that your browsing activity is more private on Firefox than on Google. 
- Easy to use and set up and does not require much storage space on your computer so you don't have to think twice about installing it.
- Ad-free reading mode included in the browser.
## Cons
- Websites & Extensions frequently have compatibility issues.
- It tends to crash more than other browsers.
- It does not have Flash support integrated so anything you use that requires Flash will not work in Firefox.
- Pocket is forced upon you with all of its upcharges.
# Our Review
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a fantastic web browser for anyone to use. It is lightweight, powerful, include ad-blocking by default, and works on every one of your devices. It also includes [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), Mozilla's Read-it-Later Service, by default so you can save your favorite articles, videos, and searches.

I have used Firefox off-and-on for the last few years. My father is a die-hard Firefox fan and has been since the Windows Vista era. It is a fantastic web browser that works well on any computer you use it on.

There are several reasons why (explained above in the Pros/Cons Section) why Firefox is chosen by many over Google Chrome.

When I have used Firefox in the past, I have liked my experience though on my Windows PC it does tend to use up more of my memory (RAM) than [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Chrome]] or [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Microsoft Edge\|Edge]] which is why I stopped using it.

Firefox has been rewritten since release to use Chromium backend so it runs off of Chrome (basically) so why it uses more memory than [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Chrome]] makes no sense to me.

Also, when installing updates, you cannot open Firefox until the update is installed which can cause problems if you are trying to use the browser for work and have to wait to use your browser for an update to be installed, especially if your internet is slow for one reason or another.

I have also been browsing the web and when I open a risky website I see most of the ads on those pages which means that it is easier to get viruses and trojans than when using a browser like [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Brave\|Brave]]. You can install an Ad Blocker extension (many of which are free to use) though that goes against their privacy focused message that they like to advertise.

Another big thing that I would like to elaborate on from the Cons above, some CSS animations and older HTML codes do not work int he browser which can make some government websites and websites that aren't constantly updated not function properly. This means that you have to use [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Chrome]]/[[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Microsoft Edge\|Edge]] anyway to view the websites.

## Do you use Firefox? Do you recommend it?
No and Yes. I still recommend Firefox because even with the cons, it still is a very good web browser. You have all of the features of Chrome, have a read-it-later service built-into your browser (without the need of a separate extension), and it is a very lightweight browser.
