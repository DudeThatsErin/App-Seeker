# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Ad-blocker, TOR Browser, and VPN built directly into the app.
- Brave Search is a more private version of Google Search.
## Cons
- Pushes their crypto on you with their Brave Wallet and their advertising.
- Built on top of Chromium so it can eat RAM just like Chrome which means heating up your PC as well as lagging it.
- Sync requires a private key which the average person is not going to do. Creating an account with its own privacy issues but is an easier solution for the non tech-savvy folks.
- Sync is really slow. Sometimes sending links from PC to phone or iPad can take 5 minutes or longer.
# Our Review

[Brave Browser](https://brave.com) is supposed to be a private browser that includes ad blocking as well as TOR browsing and a VPN. They advertise themselves to be one of the more private browsers. That comes with pros and cons. Private browsers will protect advertisers from being able to build a profile on you but that also means when you search your search results will not be as personalized which can be a good thing or a bad thing.

I have used Brave off and on in the past. These days I use [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Chrome]] because I gave up on having my privacy while also having the luxury of personalized search results. Plus, having had Google Wifi (with a Google Home built into it) plus an Android phone growing up, Google/Alphabet already knows so much about me.

Anyway, Brave is interesting. It is private though it doesn't seem like it because search results are still personalized and they try to shove crypto down your throat with their "Brave Wallet". That means they are making money by showing you advertisements randomly which isn't any better than Google or Microsoft doing that.
## It can't be all be bad right?
Right. Brave is nice because it does include the TOR browser. TOR browsers are even more private than using a browser with ad blocking. It also include ad blocking so you don't have to use a 3rd party plugin. Plus you get all of Chrome's featuers cause it is built on Chromium (the base of the Chrome browser).
## Do you use Brave?
While it is a browser I used for a while, I do not currently use Brave. I switched to [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Google Chrome]] primarily because I'd rather use the browser that all of these other browsers are based on. Chrome will get all of its features faster than Brave would. On top of that, trying to be private these days is almost impossible so I just stopped caring. Honestly, I'm happier because of it.
## Do you recommend Brave?
Yes, it is a very good browser if you can overlook the fact that it pushes its crypto currency in your face. Especially if you decide to use the Brave wallet. Then you get customized ads as operating system notifications every so often. On top of any ads you may see in your browser that Brave is unable to block.

You will get less advertisement than someone like me who uses [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Google Chrome]] or [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Browsers/Microsoft Edge\|Microsoft Edge]] and you get all of the benefits of Chrome like its Extensions and Plugins
