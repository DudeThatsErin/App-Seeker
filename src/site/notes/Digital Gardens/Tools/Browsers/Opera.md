# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- All-in-one browser that allows you to manage your emails, calendar, bookmarks, and more in this browser. You don't need to use any other apps.
- Opera GX includes RAM management utilities to make sure the browser is nto using too much of your computer's resources
- Customization is limitless. You can have a VPN and all of the apps or you can disable them all. You can get a unique experience tailored to you. 
## Cons
- RAM Management with Opera Mini (mobile browsers) is not very good and pages tend to reload when you try to switch from one app and back to the browser.
- Can use more RAM than Chrome.
- The different options for web browsers can be overwhelming to the average users.
- There is such thing as too many features. When something attempts to do everything they are a master of nothing.
- Claim to be private but you are able to chat with AI in the sidebar. All AI does is scrape your data (and conversations) to learn more.
# Our Review

[Opera](https://www.opera.com/) contains a few browsers under their umbrella. Opera GX and Opera. I will be revewing Opera as I am not much of a PC gamer and that is what the Opera GX is advertised to.

The biggest thing I can say about Opera is the last con. They are trying to be a master of everything but it is impossible. Opera has so many features that it is hard to figure out how to do anythingi n the browser. They also claim to be a private browser but they track what you use in the browser so see what features you use and don't use. Also, chatting with AI (doesn't matter what the AI is) is inherently not private. AI is made to learn and grow and get better and better and the way they do that is by recording your conversations and how you use the AI and everything that is said in the chat.

That isn't to say Opera is a bad browser. If you like the features it offers like tab grouping as well as an ad blocker, a VPN, and more. There are tons of features and Opera works well. Opera GX is also able to control its RAM usage so it doesn't bog down your computer which is pretty cool.
