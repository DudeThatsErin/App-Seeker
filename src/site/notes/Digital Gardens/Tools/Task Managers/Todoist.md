# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Available everywhere. No matter what device you have, as long as it can run Electron apps, your device can run it.
- Location-Based Reminders. This is something that not many task management apps have. There are only a handful that we have reviewed that have them like [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]] and [[TickTick\|TickTick]].
- They have the nicest, fastest, support that I have seen from anywhere. Only other support I've had like that is with Apple. You can contact them on their website (they use a Zendesk ticketing system). Refunds are processed automatically as long as you purchased within 30 days otherwise they get back to you (during normal business hours) extremely frequently. As opposed to [[Microsoft To Do\|Microsoft To Do]] which doesn't have support (besides from the community) and [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] that as limited email support.
- Natural Language Processing. This is, by far, the easiest way to enter tasks into any task management app. You can write "Water the plants every thursday, friday, and saturday at 3pm !!1 !10mb @chores" and that will create a task that repeats weekly on those days at 3pm and remind you 10 minutes before and set the priority to the highest priority of 1 and give it a label of "chores" (or create the label if you don't already have one).
- Speaking of priorities, Todoist has several. There are 4 levels of priorities which means you have greater ways to organize your tasks.
- Attachments are supported in the comments of the tasks. This is useful for adding the most detail to your tasks. I have used this *several* times with my tasks.
- You can have an almost infinite amount of sub-tasks. You can have Tasks and Sub-tasks (1 level deep) and also Tasks and sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub tasks (8 levels deep) and all tasks (regardless of how "sub" they are) function exactly the same with their own comments, notes, priorities, reminders, etc.
- Markdown is supported. Unlike the way [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] handles it. If you write `**bold text**` it shows up like: **bold text**. 
- You can have a Kanban View, List View, and (coming soon - currently in alpha testing) Calendar view for each project (or all projects). This means you can also have headers in every project which are separate sections to help organize your tasks.
- You can see all details like the project/section a task is in, any notes, any sub tasks, as well as labels in the today, upcoming or any other view without having to click on the task like you would in [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] or [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]] or [[Microsoft To Do\|Microsoft To Do]].
- Filters give a unique look to your tasks. Meaning you can customize which tasks you can and cannot see in your filter sections and these are **way** more customizable than [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]]' Smart List feature.
- They offer a free plan. It is limiting but they do offer one.
## Cons
- The app is a lot buggier than other apps. They are so focused on putting out new features (like a new look to their app and a calendar view) that things like MacOS widgets, iOS widgets and the iPad app are being left in the dark. I have more information in the review below.
- It is pricier than it's competitors. $48/year (or $36 if you were able to lock in the old pricing) is steep over time when you think about how [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] has a 1 time cost (paid in 2 years of using Todoist), [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]] & [[Microsoft To Do\|Microsoft To Do]] are free, and [[TickTick\|TickTick]] is cheaper.
- Karma system is gimmicky and annoying.
- When you have overdue tasks (just like in [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]]) the date turns red and negatively affects your karma when you have to reschedule tasks.
- There is no "Someday" or "Anytime" views though you can recreate those with filters fairly easily.
- iOS does not have background syncing so this means if you tick off a task on your iPad or Windows PC or Android and don't open the app on the iOS device, you will get notifications from tasks that you already marked as complete which can cause notification fatigue.
- The iOS widgets are the worst out of the bunch of task managers I have tried. The StandBy widget doesn't allow you to check off tasks and has a weird background to the list name. Also, they don't share as much information and do not update as frequently. Currently, there is a bug where most people using iPads or iPhones can't use their widgets at all cause they are blank.
- They are focused on adding new business customers so people like us, that don't frequently collaborate on tasks and just use it individually are left hanging with features we won't use.
- Reminders (location based and otherwise) are only available in their Pro plan ($48/mo) and you are limited to 5 Projects which is extremely limiting in their free plan.
# Our Review
![TodoistSample.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/TodoistSample.png)
[Todoist](https://todoist.com) has been around for almost 17 years (as of this writing). They are used by 30+ million people and teams (according to Todoist's website) and is very popular online primarily for its customizability and ease of entering tasks via its quick entry window and natural language processing.

As you can see from my pros and cons list above, I have some strong feelings about Todoist and that is because I find that it can be worth it due to the complexity you can give to tasks and the ease of entering tasks from any device thanks to the natural language processing.

## Why are you so harsh on Todoist?
Well, it is 2 fold. They say on their website "Rest assured that we'll never sell out to the highest bidder" though it seems like they have. Their business customers. Yes, they are still adding stuff for individuals like a new look that is for everyone and the [calendar view](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/16chbo1/calendar_view_coming_to_todoist/) which looks like below (as of a month ago when I had it for all of 1 day).
![Todoist_Alpha_CalendarView.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Todoist_Alpha_CalendarView.png)

Also, I use a Windows PC for web development (and work on one) but my primary PC is actually an iPad Pro M2 12.9" and it works really well for me. I use a USB-C to HDMI adapter and I get a dual monitor setup with stage manager. I also have an iPhone & Apple Watch.
This means most of my devices are Apple.

Apple devices are known by the [subreddit community](https://reddit.com/r/Todoist) to be left in the dust and not updated as much. The [iPad theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/16t7srt/anyone_else_saddened_by_the_lack_of_any_changes/) looks like below as of recording (I am using the **updated** theme in the experimental settings that has come to the desktop and iPhone as well):
![Todoist_new_iPad_Theme.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Todoist_new_iPad_Theme.png)
The old iPad Theme looked like this:
![Todoist_Old_iPad_Theme.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Todoist_Old_iPad_Theme.png)
Meanwhile this is PC currently:
![Todoist_PC_New_Theme.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Todoist_PC_New_Theme.png)
As you can see the iPad theme has barely been updated. This *new* theme has been in the experimental features section for over 2 months now so that puts it in a **late** beta stage which means it is close to release. Which means iPad isn't going to get an update even though I keep hoping for the PC look on the iPad. The sad part is, you can get that updated look by simply logging into Todoist via Safari on the iPad and using the browser. Then the "app" looks just like it does on the PC so that means the resolution on the iPad is possible, their team is just not adding those changes. The iPad is an after thought to them.

The app is even an after thought with stage manager. Yes, it works, but when you make it tiny (the size of an iPhone app) instead of looking like the iPhone app, it just limits the amount of information you can see on the page.

Also, the lack of background syncing drove me up the wall. This is a real world example I have of this happening:
I have a task for taking out the trash. My apartment complex has valet trash that I pay for, so I use it. That means every Sunday -> Thursday I need to set the trash outside of my apartment door for them to pick up. I have a task for those days (repeating weekly on those days) with 4 reminder times: First one at 5, Next at 6, Next at 6:30 and the last right before they pick up at 7:30pm. Let's say I take the trash out at 4 one day and mark off the task on my Apple Watch or iPhone. My iPad *will still* remind me 4 different times to take it out if I don't open the app before 7:30 or vice versa (mark it off on my iPad and don't open my iPhone app). This causes [notification fatigue](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/notification-fatigue) which (being a software developer) I am trying to fight against (especially with ADD).
I haven't had this issue in [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] during my testing and they are both 3rd party apps. Though it doesn't help that you can only set 1 reminder time in [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] versus an almost unlimited amount in Todoist (provided you pay for their Pro plan).

## Will you ever use it again?
Yes. I keep switching back because Todoist's natural language processing is the best *by far* and although you can't easily import tasks (like you can with [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]]) it is super quick to enter tasks via the quick entry box on Mac or Windows. It almost feels like Todoist is my other half, like no matter what I do I can't escape how useful it is and how many gaps in my life it fills.
Plus having the web view on computers were I don't (or can't) download the app to look at my task list is extremely useful.

I mean looking at my pros and cons list at the beginning, I obviously, *love* this app which is why I critique it so harshly in the cons portion and my review above. I want it to be better than it is.

As you can see from the PC screenshot above, I did temporarily cancel my Pro subscription but as of this writing, I have contacted them and asked for my legacy pricing back ($36 vs the $48 it is currently) plus I had a free year (expired in 2025) on my plan. ~~So, *if* I get that *then* I will 100% stick with Todoist as their support would outweigh all of the bugs I get with their app.~~ I did end up receiving my free year back from Todoist *but* they stated they didn't have a way *currently* to add back my legacy subscription price. Though, I can contact them next year and ask. I will be contacting in 6 months to check and then again right before my subscription expires. *Hopefully*, I can save that $12/year though, I am now **willing** to pay that extra $12/year because their support has been amazing anytime I've had to contact them and support means more to me than bugs and missing features on the iPad app.
