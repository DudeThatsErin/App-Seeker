# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Works well on Apple devices. Just as well as [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]].
- Doesn't penalize you for not completing tasks the day you set them. The "due date" doesn't turn red. It just has them stay in the "today" view.
- It has "do" and "due" dates. Most other task managers like [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Todoist\|Todoist]] only have "due" dates which are the dates you "do" the task.
- One-time purchase price of $10 on iOS (includes Apple Watch app), $20 on iPadOS, and $50 on MacOS. So you pay 1 time and then you use the app for its lifetime.
- Things 3 has more shortcuts that can be used. Similar to [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]].
- Uses the [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology so if you follow that, it would work perfect for your needs.
## Cons
- Only works on Apple devices. There isn't even a web interface to add tasks like [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]].
- Expensive up-front for the MacOS app.
- Things 4 could be coming around the corner at any point. So the up-front cost may not be staying when Things 4 comes out.
- You can view your calendar events in Things 3 but your tasks are unable to sync to any calendar. It is a 1-way view.
- It doesn't have durations for tasks.
- It only has 1 level of subtasks called checklists.
- No location-based reminders and no "do" times. Meaning you can't schedule a task to do it at 12pm on the 6th. You can only schedule it to be done on the 6th and then set a singular reminder for 12pm.
- Going off the last one, you can only have one reminder per task. So if you miss that reminder for some reason, you are screwed if you don't open the app consistently throughout the day.
- Seeing details of any task (besides due date and whether it is prioritized (has a star)) means you have to click on each and every task on iPad and iPhone. You can't quickly filter by tags like you can on MacOS.
- Markdown is barely supported. You can use it and links will link and items will be bolded but you will see items that way. Meaning if you want to bold something like this: **bold** it shows up like this: `**bold**` and a link shows up like this: `[google](https://google.com)` where you see everything. Defeats the purpose of using markdown, in my opinion. You can read more about this in our review below.
# Our Review
![Things 3.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Things%203.png)

[Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is an award-winning personal task manger that helps you plan your day, manage your projects, and make real progress toward your goals. It is only available on Apple devices. I am going to be going over if it is worth the one-time cost of $80 to get it on your Mac, iPhone & iPad. Let’s get into it!

Things 3 is one of my favorite task management apps for iOS. It works seamlessly on iPad, iPhone and Mac and comes with a lot more features than [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Apple Reminders\|Apple Reminders]]. One of the biggest features that I miss out on (since I'm using [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Todoist\|Todoist]]) are "Deadlines" or "Due" dates. These are the dates that a task **has to** be completed by. You can see how I use those with helping my husband track his school below:

![Things3 Deadlines.png](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Things3%20Deadlines.png)
As you can see it is super useful cause I can track when assignments are due and when the semester ends and then I can put it a "do" date which is the date I intend to remind him to work on these tasks. Then they stay on Things' "Today" view until you complete it. You can see the Today view below.
![things_today_task.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/things_today_task.png)
When it shows up on this view, on the far right side of the task you can see the deadline (if there is one) and the Area or Project it is in as well as any notes when you tap on it.
Unfortunately, this view is extremely limiting because in order to get the notes, see if the task repeats, see labels, or sub-tasks (Things calls those checklists) you have to tap on the task on iPad and iPhone. MacOS has a better view where the labels show at the top of the Today view and you can sort by the labels. I'm not sure why this functionality isn't on iPad with the screen real estate but they chose to do this for some reason.

In order to enter tasks with do dates, deadlines, or a reminder (cause you only get 1 per task) you have to click/tap on each of the areas or remember the keyboard shortcut. This means you will be doing *a lot* of tapping around the app to get things done.

You can bring up all of these options with keyboard shortcuts though I don't have the mental capacity to remember keyboard shortcuts and I always forget you can press and hold the command key (on iPad and Mac) to bring up a list of the shortcuts. These shortcuts are also unavailable on iPhone.

## Are there any other Things 3 exclusive features?

You can also use Siri to add tasks into Things with its Reminders Inbox. This is another thing I am missing with using [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Todoist\|Todoist]]. I have to deliberately add tasks to Todoist by creating a custom shortcut (and saying a different command) or try to get Siri to understand I am saying Todoist and not "To Do List" or anything else by enunciating perfectly. 

![Things3 Reminders Inbox.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Things3%20Reminders%20Inbox.png)

The last feature that I use A LOT is “Mail to Things”. This means that you can send an email to Things to create a task and allows you to use things like IFTTT and Zapier.

_Note:_ It is disabled in the screenshot because these email addresses are unique and I do not want random people adding tasks to my account 😂

![Mail to Things3.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Mail%20to%20Things3.png)

## With all of these features, what is the price?

Things 3 is $9.99 on iPhone, $19.99 on iPad, and $49.99 on MacOS. If you have all 3 devices it is $80.00. This is a hefty price though it is a price you pay **one time**. So it is a lot easier to swallow a one time payment versus a subscription. Since I only have an iPad & iPhone it was only $30 for me which is a lot easier to swallow than $48/year for [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Todoist\|Todoist]], for example.

# My Conclusion

I believe Things 3 is well worth the price. It has a ton of features, it is a one time price, and it doesn’t have any features you don’t need. After using Todoist, Apple Reminders, & Things 3, I have decided to use XXXX.
