# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Completely free for life. 
- It comes included on all Apple products and it works seamlessly with all of the Apple applications. You can create connections between your calendar, notes, emails, and freeform canvases by utilizing drag and drop.
- You can set early reminders, which means you can set a task to be due at 2:30pm on Tuesday but have a reminder at 12:30 that pings you to say "hey you need to do this by 2:30 today".
- You can view your lists in a list view or a Kanban view.
- As of iOS17 you have the ability to create a grocery smart list which automatically organizes your groceries as you add them.
## Cons
- Only works on Apple devices. You can login to [iCloud.com](https://icloud.com) on Windows and Linux though the features you get on the website are extremely limited. For example, you can't even see your smart lists.
- There are no deadlines or "due" dates.
- It only allows for images as attachments.
- It only allows for 1 level of sub-tasks and adding those subtasks is difficult, even when you account for dragging and dropping.
# Our Review
![Apple Reminders.png|700](/img/user/Digital%20Gardens/Tools/images/Apple%20Reminders.png)
[Apple Reminders](https://icloud.com) is a fantastic task management app for people within the Apple ecosystem. It works seamlessly on all of the Apple products.

## Why is Apple Reminders underrated?
This is because it has **tons** of features that aren't talked about. People usually recommend [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Todoist\|Todoist]], [[TickTick\|TickTick]], [[Asana\|Asana]], or [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Task Managers/Things 3\|Things 3]] before they recommend Reminders or even [[Microsoft To Do\|Microsoft To Do]]
