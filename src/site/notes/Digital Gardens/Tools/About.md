# Who am I?
Hello ðŸ‘‹ !
My name is Erin Skidds! I am the owner and founder of App Seeker. I have been blogging and reviewing software, websites, and hardware since 2011. I am a Full Stack Developer by trade and in my free time I love to write these reviews and spend time with my husband and cats.

I started getting into productivity apps back in 2020 and fell in love with finding the perfect one (spoiler: there isn't one!) ever since. I love adjusting my workflow to see what works best for me and that means I am always testing out new and different applications and watching videos on these applications and seeing how these businesses grow.
# What is "App Seeker"?
## Origination
I came up with this idea one day when I was bored and wanted to compare a few different apps. It started as a Google Sheets document and then I decided (with all of the requests I had from Reddit) to create a public repository/Obsidian vault for people to view this information and more.

The biggest request people had was "more information" in the comparisons so I decided to host this as a place for my reviews on apps as well as a place for people to look over the differences.
## Purpose
The purpose of this vault/website is to provide a way for anyone to look up the differences in apps. This takes a focus on the *individual* who does not collaborate but *possibly* has a family that they share tasks, notes, or passwords with.

### What about teams or businesses?
There is little, to no, focus on teams or business apps, software or services at this point in time.

While I work for a team/business, I do not have any experience managing and using software for a team so I do not feel my expertise would be best placed in this environment.

*Note:* If anyone would like to fork this repo on GitHub (listed on [[Digital Gardens/Tools/Home\|Home]] page how) and add their expertise on team/business applications that is welcome and appreciated!
