# Welcome Home
This is where I have everything stored for comparing all of my productivity tools.

If you would like to view this in all of its glory, it was made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which means that if you download and use Obsidian you can clone this vault onto your PC or phone and view it how I created it.
I made sure it was also viewable online though it is not easy to see the differences between the different apps.

## Origination
I came up with this idea one day when I was bored and wanted to compare a few different apps. It started as a Google Sheets document and then I decided (with all of the requests I had from Reddit) to create a public repository/Obsidian vault for people to view this information and more.

The biggest request people had was "more information" in the comparisons so I decided to host this as a place for my reviews on apps as well as a place for people to look over the differences.

## Purpose
The purpose of this vault/website is to provide a way for anyone to look up the differences in apps. This takes a focus on the *individual* who does not collaborate but *possibly* has a family that they share tasks, notes, or passwords with.

There is little, to no, focus on teams in these apps at this point in time.

# FAQ
## There is something wrong with this list, is there a way I can help you fix it?
Absolutely! Visit the [Contact](https://forms.fillout.com/t/qMsPWCewKVus) page and fill out the form and I will fix whatever you point out. 

Alternatively, you can fork this repo, make changes and merge changes into the main repo. I will take a look at them and add them to the main repo.

Thanks for your help!
## What are the `.obsidian` and `.obsidianios` folders?
Those are used for the Obsidian client. `.obsidian` is used on my Windows Desktop while `.obsidianios` is used on my iPad. If you decide to clone this repo, please have the same settings.

## What is the `00-assets` folder?
That is where any and all images go that I use throughout this website/repo. I add them there and link to them in the appropriate places.
