# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Open Source. This means that anyone can see how the source code
- Public Roadmap. This allows you to view upcoming features and changes and when they expect they could happen. This is a double-edged sword though because they don't always make the deadlines they promise.

# Review
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is one of the top password managers out there. It is also one of the only ones that is open-source, that is to say you can see the code that makes the app run and companies that specialize in cyber security can review the code and tell you whether the application is secure and therefore if your passwords can get hacked.

Bitwarden recently went through a face lift and now their desktop applications, mobile applications, and browser extensions look more up-to-date. You can see how the applications used to look in this screenshot. You can see how they now look in this screenshot:
![bitwarden_theme.png|200](/img/user/Tools/images/bitwarden_theme.png)

You can see that they updated this to have a more rounded look. It is a subtle change and not something you can see on the web vault (yet). I hope they bring it to the web vault sometime soon.

While it may not look as nice as [[Blogs/Software/1Password Review\|1Password]] it functions **much better**.

You can read my [[Blogs/Software/1Password Review\|1Password Review]] to understand all of my gripes with it. I will just say that it can be a bit buggy because it is trying to carry too many hats.

## Is Bitwarden Glitchy/Buggy?
No, not in the slightest. The only visual glitch I have seen is that on the Apple Watch their complication (widget) displays as 2 lines instead of showing the Bitwarden logo. See the picture below. It doesn’t matter where this complication is placed, it is always two dashes. Which is just frustrating.

This is something they have been [working to fix](https://community.bitwarden.com/t/request-bitwarden-logo-as-apple-watch-complication-instead-of/51602) since they released the Apple Watch app 2 months ago, supposedly. Though this is just a visual glitch. The apps themselves (on all of my devices) work wonderfully and I have yet to run into any bugs/glitches that are not visual ones since I started using it 3-ish years ago. 

## How secure is Bitwarden?
Since [Bitwarden is open-source](https://github.com/bitwarden) anyone is able to view their code and see how Bitwarden functions from the ground up. There is very little that a user like you or me cannot see. Which means it is reviewed by security companies that hack software for a living as well as random users that want to break things for fun. It makes them super strong.

That isn’t to say an app like 1Password isn’t secure as well. It is up to your personal preference. Though after the [LastPass Hack](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi3msavzef-AhU1tjEKHTm4AQIQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Flastpass-engineer-breach-security-roundup%2F&usg=AOvVaw12NvB1cnKxwBbwf4kKsaLY) that just recently happened, I find it hard to trust password managers that hide their code and are not open-source. This kind of hack could happen to any company that allows their users to work from home and does not have tight security on their work computers.
