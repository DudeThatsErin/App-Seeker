# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Built into your Windows PC so you don't have to go searching and downloading any other browsers when you buy a new PC.
- Easy to set up and sync to new PCs. Just sign into your Microsoft Account on your PC and it automatically syncs bookmarks, extensions, and everything else in your browser.
- Runs Chromium so you are able to install Edge Extensions AND Chrome Extensions. This also means you don't run into any compatibility issues with websites not made for the browser.
- Uses less memory (RAM) than [[Tools/Browsers/FireFox\|Firefox]] & [[Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Google Chrome]] comparatively. Even when multi-tasking with 20+ tabs open.
- Privacy features are more robust than [[Tools/Browsers/FireFox\|Firefox]] or [[Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Google Chrome]] and offer features like blocking trackers.
- You can do split screen right inside your tab/window without having to open two separate tabs (shown below).
## Cons
- Microsoft wants all of your data for advertising so while they have some privacy features they also track you EVERYWHERE while using the browser. Though it hard to find a browser that doesn't these days.
- Bing/Bing Chat/AI is forced upon you. You have to manually change to Google Search and disable Bing Chat/AI in order to stop all of those pop ups.
- When you are working on a markdown file (like I do for this website) and you copy a URL to the clipboard from the address bar (weirdly only from there) it pastes in markdown format: `[New topics - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/new)` instead of just pasting the URL. You have to manually turn this off and it isn't obvious how to do it.
# Our Review
[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) is one of the speediest browsers I have used to date. I have tried all of the browsers listed on App Seeker and when I am using Windows, I always stick with Edge if I can help it. When I am on MacOS or any Apple devices I use [[Tools/Browsers/Safari\|Safari]]. You can't get better than a browser that is built into the core of your computer. There are just too many features that built-in browsers provide that you don't get from others like [[Tools/Browsers/Opera\|Opera]] or [[Tools/Browsers/Vivaldi\|Vivaldi]].

One feature I love is the split tabs. This reminds me of the way [[Tools/Browsers/Arc\|Arc]] does split tabs. You can have 2 tabs open in 1 window as shown below. They both function like their own tabs and up in the top left where you see the title, that changes depending on the tab that is active and the blue bar on the bottom switches from left to right to tell you which side is the active tab.

Having used these tabs a few times, I can say that they are incredibly useful. You can link the tabs so whenever you click a link in the left tab, it opens in the right tab or you can leave them unlinked so they are individual tabs showing in 1 place.

## It can't all be good right?
Yes, everything has its cons. I talked a little bit about those above in the Cons section though I would like to elaborate on them.

First, about the URL pasting in markdown format... In the case above, I just copied the `https://forum.obsidian.md/new` URL from the address bar and pasted it above. It should have JUST pasted the URL but you can see it pasted in markdown format (which looks like that). In order to paste the URL only I have to deliberately remember to press `CTRL + SHIFT + V` instead of `CTRL + V`. Super obnoxious and it is not obvious how to turn it off.
As I was writing the next paragraph, I went into the settings and *happened* to click on `Share, copy and paste` and the reason why I was getting that formatting was because I had it set as seen below. Switching it to `Plain Text` does exactly what I want it to do and paste the address from the address bar without formatting. As far as what I have seen (from my research thus far) *no other browser* has this "feature", if you even want to call it that. It is a pure obnoxious annoyance than a "feature". I'm just glad there **is** a way to turn it off.

There are too many features that I had to disable to get the browser that **I** want. Just to list them they were:
- Browser Essentials - This doesn't even tell you anything remarkable anyway.
- Bing Chat AI - All this AI stuff is annoying.
- Sidebar - Not useful to me anyway.
- Bing Search - Had to switch it to [[Tools/Browsers/Google Chrome\|Chrome]] and it is buried and difficult to find this setting.
So, I didn't disable as much as I thought but when you are setting up a browser, these 4 things seem like a lot.

## Do you use Edge? Do you recommend it?
Yes and Yes. I love Edge. After having used all of these browsers it is the one that fits the uses I need it for. I am a Front End Web Developer by trade and
