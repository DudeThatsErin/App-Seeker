# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Advertising and Privacy Blocking is built into the browser. Mozilla doesn't collect as much data on its users as Google and dissociates activity from user identities. Basically this means that your browsing activity is more private on Firefox than on Google.
- Easy to use and set up and does not require much storage space on your computer so you don't have to think twice about installing it.
- Ad-free reading mode included in the browser.
## Cons
- Websites & Extensions frequently have compatibility issues.
- It tends to crash more than other browsers.
- It does not have Flash support integrated so anything you use that requires Flash will not work in Firefox.
- Pocket is forced upon you with all of its upcharges.
# Our Review
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a fantastic web browser for anyone to use. It is lightweight, powerful, include ad-blocking by default, and works on every one of your devices. It also includes [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), Mozilla's Read-it-Later Service, by default so you can save your favorite articles, videos, and searches.

I have used Firefox off-and-on for the last few years. My father is a die-hard Firefox fan and has been since the Windows Vista era. It is a fantastic web browser that works well on any computer you use it on.

There are several reasons why (explained above in the Pros/Cons Section) why Firefox is chosen by many over Google Chrome.
