## Origination
I came up with this idea one day when I was bored and wanted to compare a few different apps. It started as a Google Sheets document and then I decided (with all of the requests I had from Reddit) to create a public repository/Obsidian vault for people to view this information and more.

The biggest request people had was "more information" in the comparisons so I decided to host this as a place for my reviews on apps as well as a place for people to look over the differences.
## Purpose
The purpose of this vault/website is to provide a way for anyone to look up the differences in apps. This takes a focus on the *individual* who does not collaborate but *possibly* has a family that they share tasks, notes, or passwords with.

There is little, to no, focus on teams in these apps at this point in time.
