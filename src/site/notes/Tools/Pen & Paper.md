# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- You can carry it with you everywhere.
- You can customize the notebook and organize where task lists and 
- It is cheaper than some of the apps out there. Especially since you have to pay monthly for most apps nowadays and one-time purchases are becoming a thing of the past.
- Improves your memorization and word recognition when you handwrite something versus typing it.
## Cons
- If it rains or someone steals your stuff everything is gone.
- You need to carry it with you. If you aren't a woman with a purse or a man with some kind of backpack that is tough to do.
- Limited space by the size of the page. Rather than digital being unlimited either vertically or horizontally or both.
- Only have access to 1 pen/pencil based off what you are carrying.
- Easiest to lose and destroy.
- No backups unless you rewrite what you wrote over and over again.
# Our Review
Pencil & Paper is very easy to use. You just grab what you have laying around your home and start writing. It couldn't be easier.
