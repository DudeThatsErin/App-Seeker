Absolutely! Visit the [Contact](https://forms.fillout.com/t/qMsPWCewKVus) page and fill out the form and I will fix whatever you point out. 

Alternatively, visit our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DudeThatsErin/App-Seeker) and create an issue with any issues you would like to address. You can also fork the repo and add your own apps or changes and I will merge them into my own repo.

Thanks for your help!
## What are the `.obsidian` and `.obsidianios` folders?
Those are used for the Obsidian client. `.obsidian` is used on my Windows Desktop while `.obsidianios` is used on my iPad. If you decide to clone this repository and use Obsidian to modify the files, please keep the same settings.

## What is the `images` folder?
That is where any and all images go that I use throughout this website/repo. I add them there and link to them in the appropriate places.
