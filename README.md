# Welcome to App Seeker's GitHub Repo!
If you want to help publish updates you can either fork this repo and push your own updates or you can open an issue by clicking on "Issues" at the top and I will add in your updates.

You can view all credits [here](https://appseeker.org/about).

## Where are the files located?
When you view the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DudeThatsErin/App-Seeker) you will see the following folders:

The files are located in the `src` directory. As of writing this there aren't many notes there *but* they are specifically located in `src/site/notes/Tools`

If you are looking to contribute or you want to clone this repo so you can access this information in your own Obsidian vault (or just to keep for yourself) that's where you would go to look at the notes.

If you would like to see this in Obsidian or your markdown file editor with all of my YAML available, view the [releases](https://github.com/DudeThatsErin/App-Seeker/releases) and download the latest `tools.zip` file and unzip and open in your app of choice. In case you use Obsidian, I have also included my `.obsidian` and `.obsidianios` directories which include the themes, settings, and plugins I use on desktop (`.obsidian`) and iPad/iPhone/Mobile (`.obsidianios`).
