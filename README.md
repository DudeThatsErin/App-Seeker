# Welcome to App Seeker's GitHub Repo!
If you want to help publish updates you can either fork this repo and push your own updates or you can open an issue by clicking on "Issues" at the top and I will add in your updates.

You can view all credits [here](https://appseeker.org/about).

The files are located in the `src` directory. As of writing this there aren't many notes there *but* they are specifically located in `src/site/notes/Tools`

If you are looking to contribute or you want to clone this repo so you can access this information in your own Obsidian vault (or just to keep for yourself) that's where you would go to look at the notes.
